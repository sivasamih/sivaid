          <P style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">The memory of the Tags supplied by SIVA is programmed according a

            from the Buyer which will have to be accepted by SIVA, one or several "Ticket proof" documents will be
            issued by SIVA. Each of the “Ticket proofs” once approved by the Buyer (Person’s name & signature) shall
            formally release SIVA from any liabilities for the work carried out prior to the approval. If, at the

            Buyer (for example because of delays in supplying the necessary information, documents, materials or other
            elements to SIVA), which disrupt the work schedules and may cause errors and increase the cost price, SIVA
            reserves the right to request an appropriate additional payment.</P>

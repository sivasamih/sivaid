Without limitation, the following damages shall be considered as indirect or consequential damages and will not give rise to any liability hereunder: loss of revenue, loss of opportunity, loss of goodwill, loss of clients, loss of profits, business disruption, loss or inaccuracy of data, deprivation of enjoyment or other economic loss, even if IDENPRO has been advised of the possibility of such damage. This limitation of liability shall not apply to death or personal injury resulting from negligence.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><strorng>12.2</strorng>	If IDENPRO fails to meet the delivery schedule acknowledged by IDENPRO for reasons exclusively due to IDENPRO, IDENPRO shall for any delay exceeding a grace period of twenty(20) working days, pay to the Buyer as liquidated damages, the amount of 0,2 % of the price of the delayed batch of Products per full week of delay.

    <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"> IDENPRO shall defend, at its own expense, any action brought against the Buyer or at its option settle any claim by a third party, to the extent that such action or claim alleges that IDENPRO’ Products, as delivered by IDENPRO to Buyer, infringe a third party's patent or intellectual property right, PROVIDED that the Buyer :</p>

    <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"> In the event that any Product is held by a final court decision to constitute an actual infringement of a third party’s patent or intellectual property right, IDENPRO shall at its own costs and at its sole option, either obtain the right for the Buyer to continue using the Product or to replace or modify the Product so that it becomes non-infringing.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"> Should none of the above solutions be commercially possible to implement in IDENPRO’ judgment, the Parties agree that IDENPRO will reimburse the Buyer of the sums paid by the Buyer to IDENPRO for the Product at the date of the court decision referred to above, in full satisfaction of IDENPRO' liability.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"> IDENPRO’ defence and indemnification obligations hereunder only apply with respect to infringement of third party intellectual and/or industrial property rights by the structure of the Product, as delivered by IDENPRO to Buyer, or the inherent Product functionalities implemented solely by the Product, irrespective of the use of such Product and the applications implemented by Buyer. IDENPRO shall have no liability to the Buyer with respect to any claim of infringement (a) which arises with respect to the use of the Product by Buyer ; or (b) which results from the compliance by IDENPRO with, or the use by the Buyer or, any element, specifications methods imposed or requested by the Buyer; or (c) which results from the modification of the Product by anyone other than IDENPRO or the combination of the Product or any part of it (including but not limited to the software, any circuit, system or device) with any product, hardware, software, firmware, system or other element whatsoever not supplied by IDENPRO.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"> This section sets forth IDENPRO' entire liability with respect to any and all claims of misappropriation and infringement of third party’s intellectual and/or industrial property rights.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:0px"><strong>ARTICLE 15 – CONFIDENTIALITY</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"> <u>The Buyer undertakes to keep confidential</u> and not to disclose or transfer to any third party in any way whatsoever, part or all of the documents, data or information of whatever nature or kind, disclosed, transmitted or made available by any means to the Buyer by IDENPRO, and relating to the Products or any other proprietary or confidential information of IDENPRO.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:0px"><strong>ARTICLE 16 - FORCE MAJEURE</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"> IDENPRO shall not be considered as liable for late delivery or failure in the performance of its obligations, for reasons beyond its reasonable control such as but not limited to fire, flood, earthquake, war, strikes and lock outs, inability to obtain raw materials, any unpredictable manufacturing problem and any other unforeseeable and/or unavoidable event. IDENPRO shall send to the Buyer written notice stating the delay and cause thereof, within at least 15 days as from the dates of the occurrence of the force majeure event.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:0px"><strong>ARTICLE 17 – APPLICABLE LAW - JURISDICTION</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"> The supply contract(s) entered into between IDENPRO and the Buyer pursuant to these Standard Terms & Conditions of Business shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Belgium, to the exclusion of any conflicts of laws provisions.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"> Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this supply contract or any subsequent supply contract between IDENPRO and the Buyer, including, without limitation, with respect to its formation, validity, construction, performance, expiration or termination, shall be referred first, by notice in writing, to a senior representative of each party who shall meet and endeavour to resolve the dispute between them within 30 days of such notice. The joint written decision of those senior representatives shall be binding upon the Parties. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with the validity, construction, performance or termination of this supply contract or any subsequent supply contract between IDENPRO and the Buyer, which cannot be settled amicably pursuant to the procedure set forth above, will be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Brussels, Belgium.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:0px"><strong>ARTICLE 18 - SEVERABILITY</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"> Each provision herein is severable from the entire Standard Terms & Conditions of Business, and in the event that any provision is declared invalid or unenforceable, the parties shall endeavour to replace such provision by a provision which is valid and enforceable and reflects to the extent possible the original intent of the parties. The invalidity or unenforceability of a provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions herein contained, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:0px"><strong>ARTICLE 19 – OTHER STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"> Purchase orders shall be binding as to the products and services ordered and shall be governed by these Standard Terms & Conditions of Business. Other terms and pre-printed terms on or attached to any Buyer’s purchase order shall be void.</p>
